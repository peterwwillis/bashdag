Usage: ./bashdag [OPTIONS] [DAG ..]

Create a Directed Acyclic Graph and do stuff with it (with Bash).

Config file is (currently) just a Bash script that gets eval'd into the main
script. You can use built-in commands to create and modify the DAG, create the
DAG programmatically using Bash scripting, and access all the internals of the
script.

Options:
    -f FILE         Load dag configuration from FILE
    -s              Show parsed dag
    -r              Run all command-line arguments as dags
    -h              This screen
