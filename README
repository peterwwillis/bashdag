Usage: ./bashdag [OPTIONS] [NODE ..]

Based on a config file, create a Directed Acyclic Graph and do stuff with it.
Primarily used to execute programs according to the DAG sequence.
Pass a NODE to begin walking the DAG starting at NODE.

Config file is a Bash script that gets eval'd into the main script. You can use
functions to create and modify the DAG, create the DAG programmatically using 
Bash scripting, and access all of bashdag's internals.

Any cycles are silently ignored. Any node that has been visited once will not be
visited again.

Options:
    -f FILE         Load dag configuration from FILE
    -s              Show parsed DAG
    -r              Execute the programs specified for each dag node starting at DAG
    -0              Separate each output record by null byte
    -o TYPE         Set '-s' output as TYPE (text, yaml, json)
    -h              This screen

Config functions:

  dagdep NODE DEPENDENCY
         Define a node NODE in the dag as depending on DEPENDENCY.
 
  dagprogram NODE CMD [..]
         Define a program that should be executed for a given dag.
 
  dagrun NODE
         Recursively execute the programs in the dag starting at NODE.
 
  walkdag [NODE ..]
         Walk the dag from a particular index name, or from the root entries.
